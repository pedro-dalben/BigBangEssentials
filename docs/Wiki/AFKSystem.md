# AFK System

> **Version:** 1.0.2.6 · **Config:** `config.json` → `afk` section

## Overview

The AFK system automatically marks players as AFK after a configurable period of inactivity, broadcasts status changes, shows an indicator in the tablist, and optionally kicks long-term AFK players.

## How It Works

1. **Activity detection** — `AfkActivityHandler` listens for movement, chat, commands, and interactions. Each event that passes the threshold resets the player's inactivity timer.
2. **AFK trigger** — After `timeout` seconds of no qualifying activity, `AfkManager` marks the player as AFK, broadcasts the message, and updates the tablist.
3. **Return** — Any qualifying activity while AFK removes the AFK flag and broadcasts the return message.
4. **Kick** — If `kickTimeout > 0`, a player who remains AFK longer than that value is kicked with `afkkickMessage`.
5. **Sleep** — With `ignoreAfkInSleep: true`, AFK players are excluded from the sleep count so the night can be skipped without them.

## Anti-Spam Filter

The activity tracker has a built-in repetitive-action filter. If the same action type occurs more than 30 times in 60 seconds the score increases — at 300+ the action no longer resets the timer, preventing AFK farms via automated clicking. The score decays naturally once the window expires.
