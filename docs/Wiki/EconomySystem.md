## ChestShop

Sign-based shops that connect a chest to a sign for automated buy/sell.

### Setup

1. Place a chest
2. Place a sign on the chest (or adjacent block)
3. Write the sign in this format:

```
Line 1: [leave blank or your name]   ← auto-assigns your name if blank
Line 2: 5                            ← quantity per trade
Line 3: B 10:S 5                     ← buy price : sell price  (B only, S only, or both)
Line 4: diamond                      ← item name, or ? to assign by right-clicking with item
```

**Price shortcuts:** `B FREE` = free to buy · `S FREE` = free to sell · `1K` = 1000 · `1.5M` = 1500000

### Admin Shops

Use `Admin Shop` on line 1 — requires `bigbangessentials.shop.create.admin`. Admin shops have unlimited stock.

## Vault API

BigBangEssentials registers itself as a Vault Economy, Chat, and Permission provider. Any mod/plugin using Vault will automatically use BigBangEssentials.

| Provider | Class | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Economy | `BigBangEssentialsEconomy` | Backed by `EconomyManager`; `format()` uses live `currencySymbol` |
| Chat | `BigBangEssentialsChat` | Prefix/suffix routed through LuckPerms → FTBRanks → internal |
| Permission | `BigBangEssentialsPermission` | `playerHas()` → `PermissionAPI.hasPermission()` |

Use `/vault` to check provider status in-game.
